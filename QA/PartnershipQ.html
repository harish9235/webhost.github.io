<!--Q.1) Anil, Mukesh and Ritesh started a business each investing Rs.20,000. After 4-month Anil withdraws Rs.6000, Mukesh withdraws Rs.8000, Ritesh invest Rs.6000 more at the end of the years, a total profit was Rs.65600. Find the profit share of Ritesh.
Sol:
Let’s find the ratio between Anil, Mukesh and Ritesh
=(20000 x4 +14000 x 8):(20000 x4+12000 x8):(20000x4+26000x8)...(30000*4+26000*8):(30000*4+25000*8)::(30000*4+34000*8)
= 192000 : 176000 : 288000    328000:320000:392000
= 0.2926:0.2682:0.4390        0.3153:0.3076:0.3769
Therefore share of Rithesh will be 0.4390*65600= Rs. 28,800       0.376923077*75000=28269.2308

Q.2) Joy started a business and he invested in 76000, After some month, Amar came to join with him and invest 57000.The end of the year the total profit was divided among them into ratio form 2 : 1.Find after how many months Amar join
sol:
Let A invested Rs.76000 for 12 months and B invested Rs.57000 for x months  68k  45 k
Then (76000×12)/(57000 × X)=2/1    68000*12/45000*x=4/3
x=(76×12)/(57×2)                   816/45 x=4/3
x=8
hence B invested for 8 months

Q.3) Samir started a software business by investing Rs. 40,000. After six months, Nitish Joined him with a capital of Rs. 60,000 . After 3 years, they earned a profit of Rs . 27,900 . What was Samir’s share in the profit?

Samir invested Rs 40000 for 36 months and Nitish invest Rs 60000 for 30 months
Then Ratio of their investment=40000×36:60000×30
1440000:1800000
8:10
Total profit= Rs.27900
So, per ratio profit is=27900/18=1550
Then Samir Share of Profit=1550 x 8 =12400Rs.

Q.4 Anil, Mukesh and Ritesh started a business by investing Rs. 125000 Rs. 150000 and Rs.175000 respectively. Find the share of Mukesh, out of an annual profit of Rs. 93,600

ratio of investment= 125000:150000:175000
so, Their ratio are 5:6:7
Total profit= Rs.93600
So, per ratio profit is=93600/18=5200
Then Mukesh Share profit=5200 x 6 =Rs.31200

Q.5 Yogesh started a business investing Rs. 45000. After 3 months, Pranab joined him with a capital of Rs. 60000. After another 6 months, Atul joined them with a capital of Rs. 90000. At the end of the year, they made a profit of Rs. 20000. What would be Atul’s share in it?

Yogesh invested Rs 45000 for 12 months and Pranab invest Rs 60000 for 9 months and Atul invest 90000 for 6 months 
Then Ratio of their investment=45000×12:60000×9:90000x6
540000:540000:540000
1:1:1
Total profit= Rs.20000
So, per ratio profit is=20000/3=6666.67
Then Atul’s Share of Profit=6666.66  x 1= Rs.6666.67-->
