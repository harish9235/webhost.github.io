                        now 60-30%=42….so, final amount after 40% and 30% discount is 42 <br>

<!--Q.1 If A = 50 & B = 40 then, A is what % more than B?

Sol: consider 1% of B=40/100=0.4
A-B=50-40=10
Now, 10/0.4=25
Therefore, A is 25 % more than B.
 
Q.2) A = 50 & B = 40, if A is increase by 10 % and B is increase by 30% then what is the total percentage change?
sol:
Total(before increasing)=50+40=90  60+20=80
if A is increase by 10 %=50+((50/100)x10)=55    75
B is increase by 30%=40+((40/100)x30)=52   24
Total(after increasing)=55+52=107     99
Change in total=107-90=17    99-80=19
Therefore total percentage change=17/(90/100)=18.88%    0.8*19=15.2

Q.3) If length of rectangle is increase by 20% and breadth is increase by 10% then what is percentage the increase in area of rectangle?
Sol:
Consider, length of rectangle L=100 m and breadth B=100 m    
Length of rectangle is increase by 20%=100+20%=120 m  142    110        
breadth of rectangle is increase by 10%=100+10%=110 m 120    105    
Now, Increase in Area of rectangle=LxB=120x110=13200 m2   3200/(10000/100)=32%    11550  1150/(10000/100)=11.5%


Q.4) The population of the district of solapur is 1,00,000 the rate of increase is 10% per annum. Find the population at the start of 3rd year?
Sol:
The population at the start of 3rd year means Population of 2 years
So, First year population=1,00,000 +10%=1,10,000   200000+15%   230000
Second year population=1,10,000 +10%=1,21,000
Therefore at start of third year the population will be 1,21,000   233450

Q. 5) Which option is better, a successive discount of 40% and 30% or flat discount of 70%
sol:
Let’s Consider the amount is 100
Case A:  successive discount of 40% and 30% ,it means first 40% discount on amount, after that 30% discount on remaining amount i.e 100-40%=60,   80
now 60-30%=42….so, final amount after 40% and 30% discount is 42  72
Case B: flat 70% discount i.e 100-70%=30…so, final amount after flat 70% is 30   70
Therefore Case B is better-->
