<!--Q.1) The monthly incomes of Raja, his wife and their son are Rs.6000, Rs.4000 and Rs.1880 respectively. Find their average income?
Sol: Raja’s income= Rs.6000, his wife income=Rs.4000 and son income=1880
So, Average income=(6000+4000+1880)/3= Rs.3960


Q.2) Rajiv purchased three dozen mangoes at Rs.10 per dozen, two dozen mangoes at Rs.15 per dozen and five dozen mangoes at Rs.16 per dozen.
 Find the average cost per dozen of the mangoes that he Purchased?
 sol:
 3 dozen mangoes amount=3x10= Rs.30 5*10=50
2 dozen mangoes amount=2x15= Rs.30 30
5 dozen mangoes amount=5x16= Rs.80  3*16=48
Therefore, Average cost per dozen=total amount/total dozen=(30+30+80)/(3+2+5)= Rs.14

Q.3) The average temperature for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday was 40°C. The average for Thursday, Friday and Saturday was 41° C. If temperature on Saturday was 42° C, what was the temperature on Wednesday?
A. 39° C
B. 44° C
C. 38° C
D. 41° C
Answer: Option A
Solution:
Average temperature for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday = 40° C
Total temperature = 3 x 40 = 120° C 
Average temperature for Thursday, Friday and Saturday = 41° C
Total temperature = 41 x 3 = 123° C 
Temperature on Saturday = 42° C  
Now,
(Thursday + Friday + Saturday) - (Wednesday + Thursday + Friday) = 123 - 120;
Saturday - Wednesday = 3 
Wednesday = 42 - 3 = 39° C 

Q.4) The avg mark obtained by 40 students of a class is 86. If the 5 highest marks are removed, the avg reduced by one mark. The avg marks of the top 5 student is?
a.	92
b.	96
c.	93
d.	97 
sol:
Total marks=40x86=3440...   2280
After removing 5 highest mark the avg is reduced by 1 mark i.e. average=85 of 35 students...  74 26
After removing top 5 highest marks, the total marks=85*35=2975....  1924
Now the average of top 5 student=(3440-2975)/5=93..89

Q.5) 24 students collected money for donation. The average contribution was ₹50 Later on, their teacher also contributed some money. Now the average contribution is ₹56. The teacher’s contribution is:
A)55   B)210  C)200  D)194
Explanation:
Total money collected from 24 Students is: 24(Students)x50(rupees)=1200  65*35=2275                                                                     
Total money collected from 24 Students including Teacher is:  25 (Students +one teacher)x56(rupees)=1400   66*46=3036
Therefore, the teacher’s contribution is: 1400-1200= 200 Rupees-->
