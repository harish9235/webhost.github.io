<!--Q.1) The rate at which sum becomes four times of itself in 25 years at simple Interest will be

sol:
Let, p=100, T=25 years, 4 times in 25 years=400
So Interest amount =400-100=300
Simple Interest=[p(principal)xTxR(Interest rate)]/100
300=(100x25xR)/100
Therefore, The rate at which sum becomes four times of itself in 25 years at simple Interest will be 12%

Q.2) If certain sum of money at simple interest amounts to Rs.3250 in 5 years then the rate of interest per annum will be
sol:

Principal+interest=2800……2nd year
Principal+interest=3250……3rd year
Now, three years simple interest amount=3250-2800=450
Therefore, rate of interest per annum will be=450/time=450/3= Rs.150

Q.3) A sum of money becomes 5 times of itself in 3 years. From simple interest in how many years it will becomes 13 times?
sol:
In 3 years principal becomes 5 times at simple interest
consider principal is 100, so five times of principal amount is 500
after x years principal becomes 13 times, so principal amount is 1300
now, interest amount  3 years=500-100=400
and interest amount in x years=1300-100=1200
if, to get 400 interest amount need 3 years 
then to get 1200 interest amount it needs 9 years 

Q.4) In how many years Rs 150 will produce the same interest at 8% as Rs. 800 produce in 3 years at 9/2%

sol:
for time T
150 x (78/100) x T=800x(9/2)x100x3
  T=100x(9/2)x50
  T= 9 Years

Q.5) A sum becomes five times of itself in 20 years. It will become 7 times itself in how many years?

sol:
Interest earned =P×r×t
P= Principal amount
r= Rate of interest
t= Time period
Here, sum becomes 5 times in 20 years, 
⇒ Interest earned 4 times the principal amount.
4P = P×r×20100    
r = (420)×100     = 20%
here we need to calculate for 7 times of the principal, interest should be 600%  
i.e P+6P = 7P
Time = (600%)/(20%)
Time = 30 years-->
