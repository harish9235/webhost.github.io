R is sitting to the left of A. Who is to the right of P ?
Sol:
S and Z are in centre              _   _ S   Z _  _   
A and P are at the ends              P _ S  Z  _  A
R is sitting to the left of A      P _ S  Z  R  A  
Therefore, X is remaining, so Right of P is ‘X’


Q.3) A, B, C, D & E are sitting on a bench. A is sitting next to B, C is sitting next to D, D is not sitting with E who is on the left end of the bench. C is on the second position from the right. A is to the right of B & E. A and C are sitting together. In which position A is sitting
Sol:
A is sitting next to B      B  A  _   _   _  
C is sitting next to D      B  A  D  C  _  
D is not sitting with E who is on the left end of the bench   E  B  A  D  C
C is on the second position from the right   E  B  A  C  E
Therefore, A is sitting in between B and C.

Q.4)A, B, C, D, E, F and G are 7 friends sitting in a single row facing North.
D is to the immediate right of C, E and A are neighbor's of F, B is to the immediate left of C and on second place from left most end, A is at the right most end. Who is in between C and E?

Sol:
