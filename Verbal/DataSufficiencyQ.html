Answer: Option E
Explanation: 
From I and II, we conclude that P is M's brother and so M's father is P's father. So, F is the child of the sister of P's father i.e. F's mother is P's aunt or F is P's cousin.

Q.5) Who is taller among P, Q, R, S & T?
S is shorter than Q. P is shorter than only T.

I alone is sufficient while II alone is not sufficient
II alone is sufficient while I alone is not sufficient
Either I or II is sufficient
Neither I nor II is sufficient
Both I and II are sufficient

Answer : (C)
Explanation:
From I : P is shorter than only T, this means that P is taller than all Q, R & S, so T is tallest.
From II : Q only taller than S, so S is shortest, and Q is second shortest, Now T taller than P and R both, So tallest of all-->
