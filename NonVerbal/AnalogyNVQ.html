Q.9) Find the figure from the answer figure that will replace the question mark (?) from the problem figure.
  figure is available                   
Solution:  (4) By the careful analysis of first part of the problem figure, we find that first figure has three lines 
which become four in the second figure, i.e., form first to second figure one line is added. In the same manner, third 
figure has five lines which will transform into a six line figure in the fourth figure as shown in option (4).

Q.10) Find the figure from the answer figure that will replace the question mark (?) from the problem figure.
  figure is available                   
Solution:  (1) From problem, figure (a) to (b), the pentagon rotates 900 clockwise, and a square (having four sides) covers it. 
Similarly, from figure (c) to (d) the square (having four sides) rotates 900 clockwise and will be covered by a triangle (having three sides)-->
