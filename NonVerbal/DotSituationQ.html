Answer: Option A
Explanation:
In fig. (X), one of the dots lies in the region common to the circle and the triangle only and the 
other dot lies in the region common to the square and the triangle only. In each of the figures (2),
(3) and (4), there is no region common to the circle and the triangle only. Only fig. (1) consists of both the types of regions.

Answer: Option B
Explanation:
In fig. (X), one of the dots lies in the region common to the circle and the square only, another dot 
lies in the region common to all the three figures - the circle, the square and the triangle and the third dot lies in the region 
common to the circle and the triangle only. In each of the alternatives (1), (3) and (4), there is no region common to the circle 
and the triangle only. Only fig. (2) consists of all the three types of regions.

Answer: Option D
Explanation:
In fig. (X), one of the dots lies in the region common to the square and the triangle only and the other dot lies in the region 
common to all the three figures - the circle, the square and the triangle. In each of the alternatives (1) and (2), there is no 
region common to the square and the triangle only. In alternative (3), there is no region common to all the three figures. Only, 
alternative (4) consists of both the types of regions.

Q.6) Select the appropriate alternatives, from among the answer figures marked (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), satisfying the similar 
conditions of placement of dot(s) as in the problem figure.
figure is available
Answer: option E
Solution: In the problem figure, one dot appers in a region common to both circle and rectangle only. Such a region is present 
in the answer figure (5). Choice (5)

Q.7) Select the figure which satisfies the same conditions of placement of the dots as in Figure-X.
figure is available
Answer: option C
Solution: (3) In figure (X), the dot is placed in the region which is common to the circle and triangle. Now, we have to search 
similar common region in the four options. Only in figure (3), we find such a region which is common to the circle and triangle.

Q.8) Question: Select the figure which satisfies the same conditions of placement of the dots as in Figure-X.
figure is available
Answer: option C
Solution:
In fig. (X), one of the dots lies in the triangle alone, another dot lies in the region common to the square and the triangle 
only and the third dot lies in the region common to the circle and the square only. In each of the figures (1), (2) and (4), 
there is no region common to the square and the triangle only. Only fig. (3) consists of all the three types of regions.

Q.9) Select the appropriate alternatives, from among the answer figures marked (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), satisfying the 
similar conditions of placement of dot(s) as in the problem figure.
figure is available
Answer: option E
Solution: In the problem figure, one dot appers in a region common to both circle and rectangle only. Such a region is 
present in the answer figure (5). Choice (5)

Q.10) Select the appropriate alternatives, from among the answer figures marked (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), satisfying the 
similar conditions of placement of dot(s) as in the problem figure.
figure is available
Answer: option A
SOL:
In the problem figure, there are two dots. One dot appears in a region common to both circle and square only and another 
dot appears in a region common to both triangle and square only. Such a region is present only in the answer figure (1).
Choice (1)-->
